This day will make use of the [`nom` crate](https://crates.io/crates/nom) to
parse the input into some data structures.

## Cube Conundrum
Today, the input is a list of games, where a game consists of an ID, and a set
of rounds. Each rounds consists of pulling a number of red, green, and blue
cubes out of a bag. Each line of the input has the following shape:
```
Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
```
The first task is to determine which games of the input are possible if the
bag only contained 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue cubes. The answer is given by
the sum of the possible games' IDs.

To start, I just sketched out the types I would need to solve this problem.
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Default)]
struct Game {
    id: u32,
    sets: Vec<CubeSet>
}

#[derive(Debug, Default)]
struct CubeSet {
    red: u32,
    green: u32,
    blue: u32,
}
```
Parsing the input into a bunch of `Game`s is the first step. It's not all that
interesting, just using the parsers and combinators from `nom`. Instead of
chronicling all that, I'll just say that [the parsing code is
here](https://github.com/martinkauppinen/aoc-2023/commit/6be1b49bdda7a29259e3e69e806d2a0e7c0cbb9a#diff-658c377f84eafdfafa65b7475394dd69a85b9765cf2c933cea4daeaec65a650aR66-R102) with the starting point being the `parse_game` function and move on to the actual problem solving.

After parsing each line into a `Game`, we need to somehow check that all rounds
of the game are possible, given the maximum number of red, green, and blue
cubes before summing up all IDs.

```rust
input
    .lines()
    .map(parse_game)
    .map(Result::unwrap) // AoC input is guaranteed to be valid
    .map(|game| {
        // if game is valid, return game ID,
        // else return 0
    })
    .sum()
```

This could be done by simply checking the number of red, green, and blue cubes
in each round but where is the fun in that? Instead, I elected to implement
[`PartialOrd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html) for
`CubeSet`. A `CubeSet` is "less" than another if all its counts are less than or
equal to the other one. It's equal if all counts are equal, and greater if any
of its counts are greater.

```rust
impl PartialOrd for CubeSet {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<std::cmp::Ordering> {
        let orderings = [
            self.red.cmp(&other.red),
            self.green.cmp(&other.green),
            self.blue.cmp(&other.blue),
        ];
        Some(
            if orderings.iter().all(|o| o != &std::cmp::Ordering::Greater) {
                std::cmp::Ordering::Less
            } else if orderings.iter().all(|o| o == &std::cmp::Ordering::Equal) {
                std::cmp::Ordering::Equal
            } else {
                std::cmp::Ordering::Greater
            },
        )
    }
}
```

Why would I do this? Isn't it just moving the code elsewhere? Well, yes! But look how pretty the solution becomes now:
```rust
let max_set = CubeSet {
    red: 12,
    green: 13,
    blue: 14,
};

input
    .lines()
    .map(parse_game)
    .map(Result::unwrap)
    .map(|game| {
        if game.sets.iter().all(|set| set <= max_set) {
            game.id
        } else {
            0
        }
    })
    .sum()
```

Short, sweet, and readable. Just the way I like it. [^short-sweet]
[^short-sweet]: Ignore the longer, less sweet, slightly less readable code above it ;)

### Part 2
For part 2, the task is instead to determine the minimum number of cubes of each
color needed for each game to be possible. Then for each game, multiply those
numbers together (called the _power_ of the set), then sum up these products for every game.

This is easily done by considering the pairwise solution. For two `CubeSet`s, for the game to be possible, the
total number of cubes in each set must be at least as large as largest of the two. A simple `maximize` method can be defined on `CubeSet`, along with a `power` method:
```rust
impl CubeSet {
    fn maximize(&self, other: &Self) -> Self {
        CubeSet {
            red: self.red.max(other.red),
            green: self.green.max(other.green),
            blue: self.blue.max(other.blue),
        }
    }

    fn power(&self) -> u32 {
        self.red * self.green * self.blue
    }
}
```

Now we can start with the template from part 1 to map things over each game:
```rust
input
    .lines()
    .map(parse_game)
    .map(Result::unwrap)
    .map(|game| {
        // Get minimum set to make game possible
        // Return power of minimum set
    })
    .sum()
```

Now the new methods can be utilized together with one of my favorite iterator
concepts:
[`fold`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.fold)!

```rust
input
    .lines()
    .map(parse_game)
    .map(Result::unwrap)
    .map(|game| {
        game.sets
            .into_iter()
            .fold(CubeSet::default(), |acc, set| {
                acc.maximize(&set)
            })
            .power()
    })
    .sum()
```

Short, sweet, readable once again. :)
