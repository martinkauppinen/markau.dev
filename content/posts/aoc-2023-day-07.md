## Camel Cards
Time to play some poker! Or, well, Camel Cards. In this game, you get a list of
hands and the goal is to order these hands based on some criteria.

Each hand consists of 5 cards, labelled as a standard deck of cards:
`A,K,Q,J,T,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2`. The 10 card is labelled with a `T`. This makes
parsing easier, as every card is represented by a single symbol. I will actually
talk a little bit about parsing in this post!

There are no suits, so we don't need to worry about that. Time for the first type!
```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Clone, Copy, Debug)]
enum Card {
    Two,
    Three,
    Four,
    Five,
    Six,
    Seven,
    Eight,
    Nine,
    Ten,
    Jack,
    Queen,
    King,
    Ace,
}
```

Each hand of 5 cards has a type. This type is one of the standard types from
regular poker, bar flushes and straights, plus five of a kind:
- Five of a kind
- Four of a kind
- Full house (Three of a kind + one pair)
- Three of a kind
- Two pair
- One pair
- High card (All cards are distinct)

The above list is ordered from strongest to weakest type. I feel like it was
very kind of the puzzle authors to leave straights out of the problem. It
simplifies the solution quite a bit.

Let's model these hand types as a new type:
```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Clone, Copy, Debug)]
enum HandType {
    HighCard,
    OnePair,
    TwoPair,
    ThreeOfAKind,
    FullHouse,
    FourOfAKind,
    FiveOfAKind,
}
```
You might notice that I modelled both the `HandType` and `Card` enums in
ascending order. This is important to decide the order of the hands, whether a
hand beats another.

Firstly, a hand beats another if its hand type is stronger than the other's. For
example, `ThreeOfAKind` beats `OnePair`. This is why I derived
[`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html) and put the enum in
ascending order. Determining which is stronger just becomes a comparison like
`hand_type1 > hand_type2`.

If both hands have the same hand type, the winner is the hand with the highest
card first. If both hands' first cards are equal, then the winner is the one
with the highest second card and so on, moving from left to right.

With this in mind, the `Hand` type can be modelled, and determining which hand
of two is stronger, we can manually implement `Ord` according to the given
rules:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
struct Hand {
    cards: [Card; 5],
    hand_type: HandType,
}

impl Ord for Hand {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> std::cmp::Ordering {
        if self.hand_type != other.hand_type {
            self.hand_type.cmp(&other.hand_type)
        } else {
            self.cards.cmp(&other.cards)
        }
    }
}

impl PartialOrd for Hand {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<std::cmp::Ordering> {
        Some(self.cmp(other))
    }
}
```

And that's all the code needed for comparing hand strengths. `Ord` requires `PartialOrd`
to be implemented, but nothing stops us from implementing `PartialOrd` by
calling `Ord::cmp`. So the second `impl` is just an implementation detail.

With all the types mapped out, let's take a look at the example input:
```
32T3K 765
T55J5 684
KK677 28
KTJJT 220
QQQJA 483
```
Each line consists of a hand of 5 cards, and a _bid_. The solution to the
problem is given sorting these lines in ascending order by hand strength, 
multiplying each hand's list position (rank) by its bid, then summing the
results. The rank starts at 1 for the weakest hand, so we'll have to take that
into account.

Let's add the bid to the `Hand` struct before continuing:
```diff
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
struct Hand {
    cards: [Card; 5],
+   bid: u64,
    hand_type: HandType,
}
```

I would like to add a `Hand::new(cards: &[Card], bid: u64)` constructor method
to the `Hand` struct. But the constructor also needs to set the hand type. So
the `HandType` enum needs a method to convert from a `&[Card]` to a `HandType`.
For each card in the `&[Card]`, I'd like to go through each possible card and
check for a match, keeping track of the counts of all the different types of
cards.

This is where the [`enum-iterator`
crate](https://crates.io/crates/enum-iterator) comes in handy. It provides a
couple functions, but I'm going to make use of the `all` function -- which
returns an iterator over all enum value -- and the `cardinality` function, which
returns the number of enum values. We can create a `Vec` filled with zeroes with
size given by `cardinality`, which can be indexed by the enum value by casting
it to a `usize`. Then the `all` function can be used to iterate over all
possible `Card` values, count how many of each are in the hand of cards, and set
the corresponding element in the `Vec` to the count. This is faster than using a
`HashMap`.

After that, the hand type can be determined by checking the maximum count in the
`Vec`, along with some extra conditions:

```rust
impl HandType {
    fn from_cards(cards: &[Card]) -> Self {
        let mut card_counts = vec![0; enum_iterator::cardinality::<Card>()];
        enum_iterator::all::<Card>().for_each(|card| {
            card_counts[card as usize] +=
                cards
                    .iter()
                    .fold(0, |acc, c| if *c == card { acc + 1 } else { acc });
        });

        let two_pair = card_counts.iter().filter(|c| *c == &2).count() == 2;

        match card_counts.iter().max().unwrap() {
            5 => HandType::FiveOfAKind,
            4 => HandType::FourOfAKind,
            3 if card_counts.contains(&2) => HandType::FullHouse,
            3 => HandType::ThreeOfAKind,
            2 if two_pair => HandType::TwoPair,
            2 => HandType::Pair,
            _ => HandType::HighCard,
        }
    }
}
```

Pretty simple! The constructor is now straightforward:
```rust
impl Hand {
    fn new(cards: &[Card], bid: u64) -> Self {
        Self {
            cards: cards.try_into().unwrap(),
            bid,
            hand_type: HandType::from_cards(cards),
        }
    }
}
```

I will now actually spend some words on parsing. This is simply because I was
recently made aware of the [`nom-supreme`
crate](https://crates.io/crates/nom-supreme), which provides extension traits
for `nom` parsers that allow for some combinators to be available as postfix
methods. It will become clearer when we look at the parsing of `Hand`. First,
the parsing of a single `Card`. This is really simple:
```rust
impl Card {
    fn parse(input: &str) -> nom::IResult<&str, Self> {
        one_of("23456789TJQKA")
            .map(|c| match c {
                '2' => Card::Two,
                '3' => Card::Three,
                '4' => Card::Four,
                '5' => Card::Five,
                '6' => Card::Six,
                '7' => Card::Seven,
                '8' => Card::Eight,
                '9' => Card::Nine,
                'T' => Card::Ten,
                'J' => Card::Jack,
                'Q' => Card::Queen,
                'K' => Card::King,
                'A' => Card::Ace,
                _ => unreachable!(),
            })
            .parse(input)
    }
}
```

A straightforward mapping between the single input character and the output card
type. `one_of`, `map`, and `parse` are all from the regular `nom` crate here.
But `nom-supreme` will be used in the `parse` associatied function for `Hand`:
```rust
impl Hand {
    fn parse(input: impl AsRef<str>) -> Self {
        count(Card::parse, 5)
            .terminated(space1)
            .and(number_parser)
            .map(|(cards, bid)| Self::new(&cards, bid))
            .parse(input.as_ref())
            .unwrap()
            .1
    }
}
```

I'm unwrapping and getting the `Hand` out of the `nom::IResult` as this function
will consume the entire input slice anyway. This is not true for `Card::parse`,
which we're using in this function as a proper parser. But look at those postfix
methods! That looks pretty nice. Without `nom-supreme`, this function would have
to look like this:
```rust
impl Hand {
    fn parse(input: impl AsRef<str>) -> Self {
        separated_pair(count(Card::parse, 5), space1, number_parser)
            .map(|(cards, bid)| Self::new(&cards, bid))
            .parse(input.as_ref())
            .unwrap()
            .1
    }
}
```

Which is fine, but I don't really like the "inside-out-ness" of it. The `nom-supreme`
crate feels more readable, first parsing 5 `Cards`, terminated by at least 1
space, and then parsing a number. Both of the results are put into a tuple,
which we can then map into a `Hand` by using the constructor. This particular
example isn't that bad, but I've written more complicated parsers where the
postfix methods would definitely be a whole lot more readable.

You might wonder why `input` is an `impl AsRef<str>` rather than a simple
`&str`. I'll get to that in due time ;)

Are we done? Yes! All of this groundwork is very easily composed into the
solution to the first part:
```rust
input
    .lines()
    .map(Hand::parse)
    .sorted()
    .enumerate()
    .map(|(i, hand)| hand.bid * (i as u64 + 1))
    .sum()
```

I'm using
[`Itertools::sorted`](https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/trait.Itertools.html#method.sorted)
from the `itertools` crate to sort the hands in ascending order. That in turn
uses the implementation of `Ord` we made earlier to determine the order of the
hands. Then using
[`Iterator::enumerate`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.enumerate)
we can get the index (rank) of the hand. Finally, we multiply the index (plus
one) by the hand's bid and sum up all the results and we're done!

### Part 2
And the twist is that all the `J`s in the input aren't jacks, they're now
jokers! And a joker is any card type it needs to be to get as strong of a hand
as possible. But it is worth less than a 2 in the case of a hand type tie. So
the first step is pretty obvious:
```diff
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Clone, Copy, Debug)]
enum Card {
+   Joker,
    Two,
    Three,
    Four,
    Five,
    Six,
    Seven,
    Eight,
    Nine,
    Ten,
    Jack,
    Queen,
    King,
    Ace,
}
```

We need to modify the `HandType::from_cards` associated function to work differently if there are any jokers in the hand.
```diff
impl HandType {
    fn from_cards(cards: &[Card]) -> Self {
        let mut card_counts = vec![0; enum_iterator::cardinality::<Card>()];
        enum_iterator::all::<Card>().for_each(|card| {
            card_counts[card as usize] +=
                cards
                    .iter()
                    .fold(0, |acc, c| if *c == card { acc + 1 } else { acc });
        });

+       if card_counts[Card::Joker as usize] > 0 {
+           return HandType::with_joker(card_counts);
+       }

        let two_pair = card_counts.iter().filter(|c| *c == &2).count() == 2;

        match card_counts.iter().max().unwrap() {
            5 => HandType::FiveOfAKind,
            4 => HandType::FourOfAKind,
            3 if card_counts.contains(&2) => HandType::FullHouse,
            3 => HandType::ThreeOfAKind,
            2 if two_pair => HandType::TwoPair,
            2 => HandType::Pair,
            _ => HandType::HighCard,
        }
    }
}
```

So a new associated function called `with_joker` can be implemented to determine
the best possible hand given the joker count and the remaining cards. It's
probably worth going through the possibilities first, from most jokers to least.

- 5 jokers will be a five of a kind.
- 4 jokers + any card will also be five of a kind, as the jokers match that card.
- 3 jokers + a pair is _also_ five of a kind.
- 3 jokers + no pair is four of a kind.
- 2 jokers + three of a kind is five of a kind.
- 2 jokers + a pair is four of a kind.
- 2 jokers + no pairs is three of a kind.
- 1 joker + four of a kind is five of a kind.
- 1 joker + three of a kind is four of a kind.
- 1 joker + two pair is a full house.
- 1 joker + a pair is three of a kind.
- 1 joker + no pairs is a pair.

No other hand types are possible. Two pair will never be generated, as for a two
pair + joker hand, such as `22J33`, the joker can match either of the pairs to
make a full house, which is stronger than a two pair. And for a one pair + joker
hand, such as `22J34`, the joker will match the `2`, making three of a kind,
which is stronger than a two pair.

Now we can use the fact that the `Card` enum is ordered to split off the joker
count from `card_count`, get the hand type of the remaining cards, and just
translate the list of possibilities above into a pretty straightforward `match`:
```rust
impl HandType {
    fn with_joker(card_counts: Vec<u8>) -> Self {
        let num_jokers = card_counts[Card::Joker as usize];
        let card_counts = &card_counts[Card::Two as usize..];

        let hand_without_jokers = card_counts
            .iter()
            .enumerate()
            .flat_map(|(i, c)| {
                let card = Card::try_from_primitive(i as u8 + 1).unwrap();
                vec![card; *c as usize]
            })
            .collect_vec();
        let hand_type = HandType::from_cards(&hand_without_jokers);

        match (num_jokers, hand_type) {
            (5, _) | (4, _) => HandType::FiveOfAKind,
            (3, HandType::Pair) => HandType::FiveOfAKind,
            (3, HandType::HighCard) => HandType::FourOfAKind,
            (2, HandType::ThreeOfAKind) => HandType::FiveOfAKind,
            (2, HandType::Pair) => HandType::FourOfAKind,
            (2, HandType::HighCard) => HandType::ThreeOfAKind,
            (1, HandType::FourOfAKind) => HandType::FiveOfAKind,
            (1, HandType::ThreeOfAKind) => HandType::FourOfAKind,
            (1, HandType::TwoPair) => HandType::FullHouse,
            (1, HandType::Pair) => HandType::ThreeOfAKind,
            (1, HandType::HighCard) => HandType::Pair,
            _ => unreachable!(),
        }
}
```

I'm making use of the [`num-enum` crate](https://crates.io/crates/num-enum) for
casting the `u8` into the `Card` enum, and the fact that the `card_counts` list
is sorted by card value.

Now we just need to figure out how to make the parsing know that a `J` is a
joker, not a jack. Preferably without having to pass a bool or something like
that. Well, why not just make all `J`s into `j`s in the input and parse those as
jokers in `Card::parse`?
```diff
impl Card {
    fn parse(input: &str) -> nom::IResult<&str, Self> {
-       one_of("23456789TJQKA")
+       one_of("j23456789TJQKA")
            .map(|c| match c {
+               'j' => Card::Joker,
                '2' => Card::Two,
                <snip>
```

And putting it all together:
```diff
input
    .lines()
+   .map(|line| line.replace('J', "j"))
    .map(Hand::parse)
    .sorted()
    .enumerate()
    .map(|(i, hand)| hand.bid * (i as u64 + 1))
    .sum()
```

With this groundwork, adding a single line to the solution from part 1 solves part 2!

Remember how `input` is an `impl AsRef<str>` in `Hand::parse`? The only reason I
did that was to enable the change to be a single line. `str::replace` returns a
`String`, and so if the input was a `&str`, the solution would have to look like
this instead:

{{< highlight rust "hl_lines=4-4">}}
input
    .lines()
    .map(|line| line.replace('J', "j"))
    .map(|line| Hand::parse(&line))
    .sorted()
    .enumerate()
    .map(|(i, hand)| hand.bid * (i as u64 + 1))
    .sum()
{{< /highlight >}}

And I just found that to be too ugly for my tastes. I much prefer to just use
function names directly in `map`. And both `&str` and `String` implement
`AsRef<str>`, so it all works out!
