## Resonant Collinearity

Another grid puzzle today! We are given a grid of _antennae_, which transmit at
a specific frequency (represented by a character). So in the following grid:

```
............
........0...
.....0......
.......0....
....0.......
......A.....
............
............
........A...
.........A..
............
............
```

There are 6 antennae operating on 2 frequencies: `0`, and `A`. We need to find
some nefarious devices places at specific _antinodes_ based on the antenna
frequencies.

An _antinode_ appears when two antennae are in a line, and it appears on the
other side of the first antenna at the same distance as the second is to the
first. The given visualization example explains it pretty well:

```
..........
...#......
..........
....a.....
..........
.....a....
..........
......#...
..........
..........
```

Two antennae in a line. Two antinodes appearing outside of them, on the same
line, equally spaced.

An antinode may appear in a space where there already is an antenna. So no need
to check whether the space is free or if there's an antenna there. The task is
to count how many antinodes have appeared within the bounds of the grid.

For this, I take the good old `Point` struct:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i64,
    y: i64,
}
```

And I will implement the `std::ops::Add` and `std::ops::Sub` traits for reasons
that will become clear:

```rust
impl Add<Point> for Point {
    type Output = Point;
    fn add(self, rhs: Point) -> Point {
        Point {
            x: self.x + rhs.x,
            y: self.y + rhs.y,
        }
    }
}

impl Sub<Point> for Point {
    type Output = Point;
    fn sub(self, rhs: Point) -> Point {
        Point {
            x: self.x - rhs.x,
            y: self.y - rhs.y,
        }
    }
}
```

And a simple `in_bounds` check:
```rust
impl Point {
    fn in_bounds(&self, width: i64, height: i64) -> bool {
        (0..width).contains(&self.x) && (0..height).contains(&self.y)
    }
}
```

I parsed the input grid into a `HashMap<char, Vec<Point>>`. Since all
frequencies are independent and an antinode can appear where there already is an
antenna, we can simply loop over the entries of this hashmap, taking all
combinations of 2 antennae in each `Vec` and do some vector mathematics to
figure out where the antinodes should end up:

```rust
let mut antinodes = Vec::new();
for (_frequency, positions) in parse_input(input) {
    for p in positions.iter().combinations(2) {
        let diff = *p[1] - *p[0];
        antinodes.push(*p[1] + diff);
        antinodes.push(*p[0] - diff);
    }
}
```

I am once again indebted to the `itertools` crate with the
[`Itertools::combinations`](https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/trait.Itertools.html#method.combinations) method.
This adds all antinodes to a `Vec`, even invalid ones. Getting the count of
valid unique antinodes is then pretty simple:

```rust
let result = antinodes
    .into_iter()
    .filter(|p| p.in_bounds(width, height))
    .unique()
    .count();
```

`unique()` is also from `itertools`. It does exactly what you think.

### Part 2

Turns out, antinodes don't only appear in pairs like that. They appear equally
spaced, extending infinitely (within the grid) in a line. Equally spaced like
before, but the position of an antenna will _also_ generate an antinode.

The implementation is straighforwards. We just keep adding the difference vector
between the antenna pair until it goes out of bounds, and add all those `Point`s
to the `antinodes` `Vec`.

```rust
for (_frequency, positions) in parse_input(input) {
    antinodes.extend_from_slice(&positions);
    for p in positions.iter().combinations(2) {
        let diff = *p[1] - *p[0];

        let mut node_1 = *p[1] + diff;
        let mut node_2 = *p[0] - diff;

        while node_1.in_bounds(width, height) {
            antinodes.push(node_1);
            node_1 = node_1 + diff;
        }

        while node_2.in_bounds(width, height) {
            antinodes.push(node_2);
            node_2 = node_2 - diff;
        }
    }
}
```

The rest of the code is the same. :)
