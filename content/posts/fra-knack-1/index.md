This year, the National Defence Radio Establishment in Sweden is issuing a
cyber-security challenge every week of Advent. This post chronicles my solution
to the first of these challenges, which was a 3-flag CTF. The challenge is
available on their [challenges website](https://challenge.fra.se), which
contains a link leading to a page which looks like this:

Supposedly it's a mobile phone-friendly CTF, and there are three clues, one for
each flag you can find. Other than the clues there's just a logo and a search
bar, which will be the main focus in the challenge.

The CTF runs until the 3rd of December, so this post will be left empty until
it's over. There's a raffle for some mugs for sending in correct solutions!
