## Gear Ratios
In this episode of Christmas coding, we're tasked with finding some numbers in a
grid. The lore is that the numbers are part identifiers or something like that.
I don't know, go read the lore yourself ;). I'm just chronicling the solving process.

The example grid is given as follows:
```
467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
```
Each number that is adjacent to a symbol that isn't `.`, _even diagonally_, is a valid part
number. The task is to find all part numbers and sum them up.

When I see a grid, the first thing I think about is coordinates, so I started with defining a simple `Position` type:
```rust
struct Position {
    row: u32,
    col: u32,
}
```

Of course, we have two entities in this grid, `Symbol`s and `Number`s. Let's make types for them too:
```rust
struct Symbol {
    symbol: char,
    position: Position,
}

struct Number {
    number: u32,
    position: Position,
    length: u32,
}
```

The `Number` struct has an additional `length` field, as the space it takes up
in the grid is defined by its starting point and length. Now, I didn't know this
when solving part 1, but I had a hunch that what particular character a symbol
is was going to matter for part 2, so I added that too. I was correct.

A `Number` is valid if it is adjacent to a `Symbol`, even diagonally. Or in
other words, if there is a `Symbol` inside of a rectangle that surrounds the
`Number`, but is one unit larger in all dimensions. Hey, that's a pretty neat idea. Let's make a `Rectangle` struct that can check if it contains a point.
```rust
struct Rectangle {
    top_left: Position,
    bottom_right: Position,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn contains(&self, position: &Position) -> bool {
        self.top_left.row <= position.row
            && self.bottom_right.row >= position.row
            && self.top_left.col <= position.col
            && self.bottom_right.col >= position.col

    }
}
```

And now a helper method that can construct the proper bounding `Rectangle` for a `Number`:
```rust
impl Number {
    fn rect(&self) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle {
            top_left: Position {
                row: self.position.row.saturating_sub(1),
                col: self.position.col.saturating_sub(1),
            },
            bottom_right: Position {
                row: self.position.row + self.length + 1,
                col: self.position.col + self.length + 1,
            },
        }
    }
}
```

We have to use
[`saturating_sub`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html#method.saturating_sub)
because we can't have negative numbers in `Position`s, and some `Number`s start
at row or column 0. So in these cases the `Rectangle` is slightly smaller than
normal, but that's fine.

Now let's put all this together in a `Grid` struct:
```rust
struct Grid {
    symbols: Vec<Symbol>,
    numbers: Vec<Number>,
}
```
And time for parsing. Once again, this is not particularly interesting, just a
bunch of `nom` parsers and combinators, with the only complications begin the
bookkeeping of the row and column being parsed, and getting the length of a
parsed number using
[`u32::ilog10`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html#method.ilog10).
[Parsing code is here](
https://github.com/martinkauppinen/aoc-2023/commit/62f6854dc45f2103739f24d075584b2266062f1c#diff-da11a58f84a9d7b71df095eaca2135703a7dfe3f06cf5237252e2fdf2a45d994R60-R108), starting in `parse_grid`.

Now for the solution. It's pretty simple, by using the `Number::rect` and `Rectangle::contains` methods defined above to filter the numbers by whether their rectangle contains any symbol in the grid:
```rust
let grid = parse_grid(input);
grid.numbers
    .into_iter()
    .filter(|number| {
        let rect = number.rect();
        grid.symbols
            .iter()
            .any(|symbol| rect.contains(symbol.position))
    })
    .map(|number| number.number)
    .sum()
}
```

### Part 2
I was right about the specific character of the symbols being important for this
part. This time, the task is to find all `*` symbols (gears) that are adjacent
to _exactly_ 2 numbers, and sum up the product of all those pairs. Luckily,
since I saved the character in each symbol, the grid's symbols can be filtered
on this:
```rust
let grid = parse_grid(input);
grid.symbols
    .into_iter()
    .filter(|symbol| symbol.symbol == '*')
    .map(|gear| {
        // Get all numbers adjacent to the gear
        // Check that there are exactly 2
        // Return the product of the numbers
    })
    .sum()
}
```

The easy way to go about this is to simply create an iterator over all numbers
in the grid whose rectangle contains the current gear.
```rust
let grid = parse_grid(input);
grid.symbols
    .into_iter()
    .filter(|symbol| symbol.symbol == '*')
    .map(|gear| {
        let mut numbers = grid
            .numbers
            .iter()
            .filter(|number| {
                number.rect().contains(gear.position)
            });
        
        let first = numbers.next();
        let second = numbers.next();
        let third = numbers.next();

        if let (Some(first), Some(second), None) = (first, second, third) {
            first.number * second.number
        } else {
            0
        }
    })
    .sum()
}
```
And this works fine. It gives the right answer, only outputting non-zero for
each gear with _exactly_ two numbers adjacent to it, and was my initial solution.

I did spot an inefficiency though. It's unnecessary to iterate over all numbers
in the grid, as the only numbers that have a rectangle that contains the gear
are the ones whose row is 1 less than, equal to, or 1 greater than the gear's
row.

The fix is simple:
```diff
let grid = parse_grid(input);
grid.symbols
    .into_iter()
    .filter(|symbol| symbol.symbol == '*')
    .map(|gear| {
        let mut numbers = grid
            .numbers
            .iter()
+           .skip_while(|number| {
+               number.position.row < gear.position.row.saturating_sub(1)
+           })
+           .take_while(|number| {
+               number.position.row < gear.position.row + 2
+           })
            .filter(|number| {
                number.rect().contains(gear.position)
            });
        
        let first = numbers.next();
        let second = numbers.next();
        let third = numbers.next();

        if let (Some(first), Some(second), None) = (first, second, third) {
            first.number * second.number
        } else {
            0
        }
    })
    .sum()
}
```

This brought the benchmark time down from about 500 microseconds to about 250.
Twice as fast. That's pretty nice :)
