I recently had a 4-day weekend where I essentially did nothing but code. And
even though I have a nice, supposedly ergonomic keyboard, bad static posture and
extended sessions over several days will mess with your wrist and elbow.
Remember to take breaks, shift your posture, and put the keyboard down every
once in a while. No matter how interesting you find your current project.

I haven't had any pain per se, but my right arm has been entirely unable to rest
comfortably on the keyboard for the past few days. This weekend I have stayed
away from the computer apart from writing this post. I've been doing stretches
and exercises, and applying heat to the arm. It seems to be working pretty well,
although the problem is not quite gone yet. If it goes on another week or so, I
will book an appointment with a physiotherapist.

Take care of yourself. Don't do this.
