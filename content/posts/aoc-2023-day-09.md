Another post under the influence of covid. Like day 8, I'll be brief.

## Mirage Maintenance
This is a pretty simple one. The input is a list of time sequences:
```
0 3 6 9 12 15
1 3 6 10 15 21
10 13 16 21 30 45
```

And our job is to predict the next number for each sequence and sum up the
values of all predictions. A prediction is made by repeatedly taking a discrete derivative
of the sequence until reaching a constant state, predicting the next value of
that, then bubbling up. [See the actual problem
description](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9) for a really good explanation
of the problem. I feel like I can't reword in in a better way than the problem
was already put.

Basically, If we have a sequence of all zeroes, the next value will be zero. If
this is not the case, we create a new sequence from the pairwise difference of
numbers in the sequence, predict the next value of that, and the next value of
the current sequence is the last value plus the predicted value of the sequence
of differences. Here's the function that does just that (with help from the [`itertools` crate](https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/)):
```rust
fn predict_value(values: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    if values.iter().all(|x| *x == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    let lower_sequence = values
        .iter()
        .tuple_windows()
        .map(|(a, b)| b - a)
        .collect_vec();
    let last = values.last().unwrap();
    predict_value(lower_sequence) + last
}
```

That's it. That's the puzzle.

### Part 2
Part 2 asks to predict a value backwards in time, i.e. what was the value before
the first? Just reverse each sequence and call the same function.
