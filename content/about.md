Hi there! As mentioned on the front page, the name is Martin. Software developer
by trade, with a special place in my heart for the Rust language and weird
quirks of computers and technical systems.

I keep this blog as a way to get better at writing and for future reference, in
case I ever want to bring up _that one fun little weird thing I did a year ago_
in conversation without having to rack my brain too much.

Updates may be sporadic, but I promise they're always interesting in some way.
At least to me, otherwise I wouldn't write about them. And I consider myself to
be my main audience anyway, so in a sense I have very good reviews on all my
posts. ;)

All opinions shared are my own, and do not represent any employers past,
present, or future.

Enjoy your browsing!
